## The Smart Assets System

NEM is a blockchain platform built from the ground up to be simple for developers to use.

NEM is built around a powerful system to customize your use of the blockchain. We call it the **Smart Asset System**. It gives you the power to use NEM as if it were a custom blockchain built for your application and your assets.

Rather than forcing you to write your own “smart contract” from scratch or using off-blockchain methods to define custom assets for your application, NEM gives you direct access to a **specialized set of tested and secure on-blockchain features**.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 **Making API calls**, you can configure your own "Smart Assets" and make use of NEM’s powerful blockchain platform as your fast, secure, and scalable solution.

## Public and Private

NEM provides both a decentralized, open and self-sustaining **public blockchain** that can be used by anyone – as well as a **permissioned/private blockchain solution** that you can use when speed and privacy are the priority.

## Getting started
