## What?

NEM is a **flexible blockchain** technology.  Instead of uploading all the application logic into the blockchain, you can use its tested features through API calls for:

* Transfer and storage of value.
* Authorisation.
* Traceability.
* Authentication.

The rest of the code remains **off-chain**. This reduces the inherent **immutability risk**, as you could change the process when necessary.  For example, after receiving feedback from the users, you may need to change your software adding new or unexpected functionality.

We will start with a very basic  **minimum viable product**. Then, as the workshop continues, we will be adding some more complexity.

1) As a warehouse operator, I want to register a product.

2) As a warehouse operator, I want to register if a product is safe for consumption.
